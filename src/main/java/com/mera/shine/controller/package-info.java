/**
 * This package contains all REST controllers for the Shine application.
 * 
 * The controllers are organized by entity and provide CRUD operations for each entity.
 * All controllers follow a similar pattern:
 * - GET /api/{entity} - Get all entities
 * - GET /api/{entity}/{id} - Get a specific entity by ID
 * - POST /api/{entity} - Create a new entity
 * - PUT /api/{entity}/{id} - Update an existing entity
 * - DELETE /api/{entity}/{id} - Delete an entity
 * 
 * Additional endpoints may be provided for specific use cases.
